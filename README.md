# Number Theory Scripts

This repo contains the code I used for my assignments in a Number Theory course. The scripts were sort of just thrown together. Please let me know if you have any questions about this.

## Course information
MATH 0420: Introduction to Number Theory
Brown University
Spring 2019
Textbook: [A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory, 4th ED](https://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/frint.html) (denoted as _FRINT_ in the code)


## Running the code
The code expects `Python 3.6.3`. Here are some examples of how to run the code:
```sh
python congruence-solver.py
```
OR
```sh
./congruence-solver.py
```
